## Identification of membrane proteins as specific biomarkers of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
The identification of specific biomarkers can significantly improve sensitivity and specificity in the early detection of PDAC. In this study, we performed the identification and selection of specific biomarkers overexpressed in pancreatic tumor tissue relative to normal tissue. We make use of publicly available proteomic data for the search of a study cohort, as well as bioinformatics tools to analyze the abundance and characteristics of proteins present in tumor and normal samples. We use available single-cell, immunohistochemistry, and survival data for candidate validation, as well as immunoinformatics tools for the identification of potential neoantigens with potential application in vaccines. The aim of this research is the identification and study of cell membrane biomarkers with a view to their application in personalized therapies, seeking greater effectiveness and contributing to improve early detection of this disease.
